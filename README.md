Traffic Flagger Project for HopHacks 2018

The purpose of Traffic Flag is to improve efficiency of police presence in Baltimore. Through clean and organized view of previous citation data, officers can have a good understanding of hot spots around the city and focus on such areas with future patrols. With data presented in a visually easing manner, it enables a much easier experience for officials to analyze and conclude patrol routes and prevention plans.

We used the Google Maps API to plot citations and display hotspots. The whole project used Google AppEngine for the backend and Google Cloud Datastore to store login information.
